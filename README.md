# Supermarket-Manager

**Front-end** made with **React** and **Typescript** that offers a GUI with which users can manage orders for existing products in a supermarket.
<br>
<br>
**Back-end** made with **Java** using the **Spring Framework**.
<br>
<br>
To manage its **MySQL database** I use the GUI-based application **phpMyAdmin**, inside which are stored the tables that handle information about the clients, products and orders of a supermarket.
